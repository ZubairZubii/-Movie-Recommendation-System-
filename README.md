## 🚀 **About The Project**

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System**! This project leverages **NLP**, **machine learning**, and the power of the **TMDB API** to suggest movies based on the selected title. Using **cosine similarity** and a variety of NLP techniques like stemming and vectorization, this system recommends the most relevant movies to users. The UI is built with **Streamlit**, offering an easy-to-use interface for movie lovers 🎥🍿.

🔗 **[Demo Video](https://www.loom.com/share/19409b6c0c314a8482bdf46fed64b500?sid=284df75f-ab43-4385-88d8-54184308ebb9)**  
Check out the **live demo** to see the system in action!

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & Numpy** 🧮
- **NLP Techniques** (Stemming, Vectorization) 🗣️
- **Cosine Similarity** 📏
- **TMDB API** 🔥
- **Streamlit** 🌐

## 🎯 **Features**

- **Personalized Movie Recommendations**: Select a movie from a list and get similar titles based on genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- **Clean & Responsive UI**: A sleek interface designed with custom CSS for a smooth user experience.
- **Interactive Movie Posters**: See posters of recommended movies alongside their titles.
- **Powered by TMDB API**: Real-time poster fetching via the **TMDB API**.

## 💡 **How It Works**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   The dataset is merged, cleaned, and preprocessed. Keywords, genres, cast, and crew details are extracted using **ast.literal_eval** and converted into lists.

2. **Text Vectorization**:  
   The **CountVectorizer** from scikit-learn converts the "tags" (genres, keywords, etc.) into a matrix of token counts, ensuring the most important features are captured.

3. **Cosine Similarity**:  
   We calculate the similarity between movies based on their vectorized tags using **cosine similarity**. The movies with the highest similarity score are returned as recommendations.

4. **Poster Fetching**:  
   Movie posters are fetched in real-time using the **TMDB API** to provide a more engaging user experience.

## 🧩 **Dependencies**

Before running the project, make sure you have installed the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit requests nltk
```

Additionally, you'll need to download the **nltk** stopwords and stemmer for text processing:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## 💻 **How to Run the Project**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZubairZubii/movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Select your favorite movie, hit **Recommend**, and enjoy personalized movie recommendations!
